## Problem

Write a program such that:

1. Ask the user to enter the price of a product A and product B. Store
them as doubles.
2. Print the total cost, including sales tax. Assume the tax rate is
8.875%.
3. If the total cost is more than 20 dollars, print "It's expensive!" (Try
this even though you have not learned if statements.)
