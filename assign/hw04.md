## Problem

The purpose of this assignment is to practice with logic expressions and more math expressions. You will create a program that will prompt the user for 3 test scores, determine the max and min of the test scores, calculate the average of the test scores, and determine the letter grade corresponding to the average.

Each test score will be integer values, however the average will need to be a float to preserve precision. You will also need two integer variables to record the max and min test score. Use the standard letter grade scale (ex: 90.0-100 A, 80.0-89.99 B, 70.0-79.99 C, etc)

### Pseudocode

    prompt for 3 test scores within the range 0 - 100
    read in the test scores

    validate that each test score is within the range, if not exit the program

    determine the max and min of the three test scores

    calculate the average of the three test scores

    display to the user the three scores entered, 
    the max score,
    the min score,
    the average (up to 2 decimal places),

    and the letter grade corresponding to the average
    if( average is within range for an A score )
      display an 'A'
    else if ( average is within range for a B score)
      display a 'B'
    .
    .
    else
      display an 'F'
