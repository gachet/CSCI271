## Problem

Write a program that inputs the starting balance, the amount deposited, the number of checks, and the total value of all of the checks, and computes the monthly service fee for a checking account according to the following schedule:

- &#36;15 if the balance at the start of the month is less than &#36;400
- &#36;15 if the balance at the end of the month is less than &#36;400
- &#36;25 if the average check value is more than &#36;500
- &#36;50 if the balance at the end of the month is negative

In addition, there is a per-check fee which is computed as follows:

- checks 1 - 19 in any given month cost &#36;0.10 each
- checks 20 - 39 in any given month cost &#36;0.08 each
- checks 40 - 59 in any given month cost &#36;0.06 each
- additional checks cost &#36;0.04 each

If the starting balance is negative, the program should exit with the statement that the account has been closed.

The program should be designed for clarity and testing -- using carefully chosen variable names and displaying fees as they are incurred (along with the reason for the fee) will go most of the way to accomplishing this.
